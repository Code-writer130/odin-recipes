    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Jollof rice originated from the Wolof people of Senegal and Gambia. And has been adopted and adapted by many West African countries, 
        including Ghana and Nigeria. Both countries use different ingredients and cooking methods. </p>
    <p>Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients;for example, in Mali it is called zaamè in Bamanankan. 
        The dish's most common name of Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people,
         though in Senegal, Mauritania and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ceebu jën or benachin.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
